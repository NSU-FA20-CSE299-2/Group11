<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>We decided to go with latest technologies for developing this application in order to give users a better experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Frontend</em></p>
<p>For the front end we will be using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. This enables cross platform development which allows the web app to be compatible with both PC and mobile platforms. It also gives a more premium user interface and smoother experience.</p>
<p><em>Backend</em></p>
<p>PHP will use for backend. PHP ensures rapid development providing high security and maintanence.</p>
<p><em>Database</em></p>
<p>We will be using mysql as the database.</p>
<p><em>Additional technologies</em></p>
<p>Allauth for php will be used to allow users to login using their Facebook and/or Google account.</p>
<p>We will integrate a real-time chatting system using php within the website.</p>
<p><strong>Database</strong></p>
<p>The database was the trickiest part for a system such as this. We needed something with a graph structure. However, due to time constraints and the complexity of designing such a structure on a huge existing database became rather difficult. We ended up using phpmyadmin,  it will handle our entire database. It is not as fast and easily accessed like a graph structured database but it does quite good with the limited data involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Payment</strong></p>
<p>Our user can pay in several ways. They can pay in cash on delivery or by card. Card works on
reputed shop only.</p>
<p><em>Profit</em></p>
<p>When seller post an add they have to pay a registration fee. There are few label of reg. fee. The
label are:
<p>• 0% on small transaction like 0-1,000</p>
<p>• 5% on medium transactions like 1001-10,000</p>
<p>• 10% on big transaction like 10,001-no limit</p>
This registration fee will collect by the website.
This is how this application is profitable for all of seller, buyer and developer.<p/>
